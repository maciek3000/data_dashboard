"""It was intentional to not test  plots - it would involve building a lot of mockups to something that can be also
    checked in the frontend directly (only visuals - by design Plot objects are limited when it comes to
    calculating the data beneath). Limited time resources to properly build such test cases (and learn the way to do it
    in the first place) were the reason to abandon the majority of Unit Testing of Plots.

    It would be nice to test dropdowns JS though."""
